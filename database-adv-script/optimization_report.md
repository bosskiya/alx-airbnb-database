# Optimization Report

    ðŸš¨ Potential Inefficiencies:
        Full Table Scan on Booking (type = ALL):
            If there's no index on user_id or property_id, the DBMS will scan the entire table.
            Fix: Ensure Booking.user_id and Booking.property_id are indexed.

        Join on u.user_id = p.host_id in WHERE Clause:
            The join logic that compares two different tables (User and Property) in the WHERE clause can prevent the optimizer from using indexes efficiently.
            Fix: You might consider refactoring this logic (see below).

        SELECT * (Fetch All Columns):
            Fetching all columns leads to more I/O and worse performance, especially if columns like description, password_hash, etc., are large.
            Fix: Select only the columns you need.
